CodeSoft_DataScience_Internship_Tasks

Here is collection of work from my data science internship! You may discover a few of the projects I worked on during my internship at Codsoft in this repository. My abilities in data analysis, and machine learning are demonstrated in each project. An overview of the projects is given below:

Titanic Survival Detection Project: • The goal of this project is to predict passenger survival by analyzing the Titanic dataset. It includes activities data preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to forecast survival probabilities.

Movie Rating Prediction with Python Project: • The goal of this project is to use Python to create a movie rating prediction system. The phases of it include data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a machine learning model to predict movie ratings.

Iris Flower Classification Project: • Using the Iris dataset, the Iris Flower Classification project uses traditional machine learning to the task of classifying iris flowers into different species according to measurements of their sepals and petals.

Sales Prediction using Python Project: • The goal of this project is to forecast a company's sales. Preprocessing data, exploratory data analysis, and creating a predictive model to project future sales are all included.

Credit Card Fraud Detection Project: • The creation of a model based on machine learning intended to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project uses logistic regression for efficient classification, preprocesses the data, and tackles class imbalance.
