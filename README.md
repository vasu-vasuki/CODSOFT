Explanation:Steps in this model building by using ml algorithm and datascience.We used logistic regression.

1.Importing Libraries: We import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

2.Loading the Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset into a DataFrame and display the first few rows.

3.Exploring and Cleaning the Data: Check for and handle missing values. Drop irrelevant columns.

4.feature Engineering: Convert categorical variables to numerical ones and create dummy variables for categorical features.

5.Model Building: Split the data into training and testing sets, standardize the features, and build a logistic regression model.

6.Model Evaluation: Make predictions on the test set, calculate accuracy, and display the confusion matrix and classification report.
